# PosePerfect_AI

## Inspiration
PosePerfect AI was born from our passion for combining technology with wellness. We wanted to create a tool that not only enhances the yoga experience but also empowers users to practice with confidence and precision, no matter their skill level.

## What it does
PosePerfect AI utilizes your device's camera to analyze and provide real-time feedback on your yoga poses. It guides you through each pose, offering corrections and duration tracking. With a diverse library of poses like tree pose, warrior pose, and more, users can customize their practice to suit their needs.

## How I built it
I trained the AI model using a combination of yoga pose images and datasets from Mediapipe and Python. We leveraged HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop an intuitive and user-friendly website interface that seamlessly integrates with the AI model.

## Challenges I ran into
One of our main challenges was fine-tuning the AI's accuracy and responsiveness to different body types and angles. We also focused on optimizing the website's performance for smooth user interaction and data processing.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are proud to have developed a robust AI system that not only accurately detects yoga poses but also provides valuable insights into form and duration. Our website's design and functionality reflect our commitment to creating a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

## What we learned
Throughout this project, we deepened our understanding of machine learning, computer vision, and web development. We also learned valuable lessons about user engagement and feedback, which will inform our future endeavors.

## What's next for PosePerfect AI
Looking ahead, we aim to expand PosePerfect AI's capabilities by incorporating advanced features such as personalized routines, progress tracking, and social sharing options. We also plan to collaborate with yoga experts to enhance the quality of our pose guidance and educational content.
